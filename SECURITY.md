## 🔐 Security Controls

### 1. Azure Key Vault
**Purpose**: Secure storage of secrets, keys, and certificates

**Implementation**:
- All sensitive data stored in Key Vault
- Automatic secret rotation
- Soft delete and purge protection
- RBAC-based access control

**Stored Secrets**:
- Gemini API key
- Application secret keys
- Database credentials (if applicable)
- SSL certificates

### 2. Managed Identity
**Purpose**: Secure authentication without storing credentials

**Implementation**:
- System-assigned managed identity for App Service
- No credential management required
- Automatic token rotation
- Least privilege access

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates credential theft risk
- Reduces operational overhead
- Improves auditability

### 3. Network Security
**Network Security Groups (NSG)**:
- Restrict inbound/outbound traffic
- Allow only necessary ports (80, 443)
- Deny all other traffic by default

**DDoS Protection**:
- Mitigate distributed denial of service attacks
- Automatic traffic monitoring
- Real-time attack mitigation

**Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
- Filter malicious HTTP requests
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- Custom rule sets
- Real-time threat intelligence

### 4. Container Security
**Image Scanning**:
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Trivy scanner integration
- Critical and high severity alerts
- Automated scanning in CI/CD

**Security Best Practices**:
- Non-root containers
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Multi-stage builds
- No unnecessary packages

### 5. Application Security
**HTTPS Only**:
- Force encrypted connections
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- HSTS headers
- SSL certificate management

**TLS Configuration**:
- Minimum TLS 1.2
- Modern cipher suites
- Perfect Forward Secrecy
- Certificate transparency

**Input Validation**:
- Pydantic models for API validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

**Rate Limiting**:
- API rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- IP-based throttling
- Burst protection
- DDoS mitigation

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
**Security Alerts**:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns
- High error rates
- Resource usage anomalies

**Audit Logging**:
- All security events logged
- Centralized log collection
- Long-term retention
- Compliance reporting
