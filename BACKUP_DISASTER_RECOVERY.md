## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- Automated daily backups of the SQLite database
- Retention period: 30 days
- Backup location: ./backups/database/

### Model Backups
- Model files are versioned in Git
- Additional backups stored in Azure Blob Storage

### Configuration Backups
- Environment files backed up daily
- Docker configurations versioned in Git

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. Stop the application
2. Restore database from latest backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Restart the application

### Model Recovery
1. Pull latest models from Git
2. Restore from Azure Blob Storage if needed
3. Verify model functionality
4. Update model paths in configuration

### Full System Recovery
1. Provision new infrastructure
2. Deploy application from Git
3. Restore database and models
4. Update DNS and load balancer configuration
5. Verify system functionality

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Database recovery: 15 minutes
- Model recovery: 30 minutes
- Full system recovery: 2 hours

## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Database: 1 hour maximum data loss
- Models: No data loss (version controlled)
- Configuration: No data loss (version controlled)
